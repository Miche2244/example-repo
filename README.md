Shoe Inventory Management System


This project is a Python based inventory management tool designed to help a business track and manage shoe stock. 
The program reads data from an inventory.txt file, creates Shoe objects, and allows the user to perform actions such as viewing all shoes, adding new stock,
restocking low quantity items, searching for shoes by code, calculating the value of each item, and identifying the product with the highest quantity. 
All updates are written back to the inventory file to keep the data consistent.
